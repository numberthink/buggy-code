# Buggy code

This buggy code creates a scene with a bunch of bugs flying and buzzing around. 

It uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to create the "buzzing" oscillators.

The "bugs" are made with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/). 

To run locally:

```bash 
npm install

npm run dev

```
